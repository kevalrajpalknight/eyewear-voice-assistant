# Protocol notes

Every claim is labelled CONFIRMED (observed on this unit) or INFERRED / UNVERIFIED.
Evidence: `aiglasses scan`, `gatt-dump` and `listen` runs against unit AIMB-G2_2324 on Windows 11 (bleak 3.0.2, uncached GATT services, no pairing), 2026-10-30.

## Verdict on the 0xAE00 / RCSP hypothesis

| Claim | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Custom service 0xAE00 with AE01 (write-no-resp) and AE02 (notify) | **DENIED as stated** | No 0xAE00 service exists. The unit has 0xAE30 (AE01, AE02, AE03, AE04, AE05, AE10) and 0xAE3A (AE3B, AE3C). The AE01 write-no-response and AE02 notify characteristics do exist, under 0xAE30. |
| Jieli-style control channel | **INFERRED (plausible)** | AE-prefixed custom UUIDs with write-no-response + notify pairs match the Jieli pattern; Jieli JL7018F is claimed by the spec sheet (unverified). |
| RCSP framing (`FE DC BA ... EF` or `FE EF AA 55 | len | payload | sum16`) | **INCONCLUSIVE** | No frame has been observed. The only notification seen (below) starts with `bc 73`, matching neither header. Nothing has been written, so no response frames exist to inspect. |

The answer needs the Phase 3 capture of the official app.

## Advertising (CONFIRMED)

- Name `AIMB-G2_<last 2 MAC bytes>`; MAC `D0:4B:1B:C3:23:24`.
- No service UUIDs advertised; service data `0x3802` = own MAC bytes; manufacturer ID `0x1234`, empty payload.
- The unit stops advertising after a while or while another central is connected; toggling glasses Bluetooth makes it advertise again.
- Windows lists it under "New devices" as an Audio device, i.e. it also advertises Classic Bluetooth audio. Not paired or tested yet.

## GATT (CONFIRMED, MTU 517, connects without pairing; full data in `logs/gatt_dump.json`)

| Service | Characteristics (handle: properties) |
|---|---|
| 0x1800 Generic Access | 2A00 (2: read, write) = `AIMB-G2_2324` |
| 0xAE30 | AE01 (5: write-no-resp), AE02 (7: notify), AE03 (10: write-no-resp), AE04 (12: notify), AE05 (15: indicate), AE10 (18: read, write; empty) |
| 0x3802 | 4A02 (49: read, notify, write; empty) |
| 0xAE3A | AE3B (65: write-no-resp), AE3C (67: notify) |
| 0x1801 Generic Attribute | 2A05 (71: indicate). Enabling it is refused with "Access Denied", so it needs a bonded link. |
| Nordic UART `6e40fff0-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` | 6e400002 (135: write, write-no-resp), 6e400003 (137: notify) |
| Vendor `de5bf728-d711-4e47-af26-65e3012a5dc7` | de5bf72a (141: write, write-no-resp), de5bf729 (143: notify) |
| 0x180A Device Information | 2A25 serial (empty), 2A27 hardware `AM01G1_V9.4`, 2A26 firmware `AM01G1_9.40.00_260114`, 2A23 System ID `2423c300001b4bd0` |
| 0xFEE1 | FEE3 (160: read, write, notify; empty) |

- CONFIRMED: no Battery service (0x180F); battery must come through a custom command.
- INFERRED: System ID `24 23 c3 00 00 1b 4b d0` encodes the MAC bytes in reverse order (24 23 C3 ... 1B 4B D0 = D0:4B:1B:C3:23:24, with 00 00 filling the manufacturer-defined bytes).
- CONFIRMED: 8 of 9 notify/indicate characteristics accept the standard CCCD enable.

## Notifications

- CONFIRMED (earlier prototype run, 60 s window): one notification on `de5bf729` (h143): `bc7303005231054700`, shortly after subscribing. Meaning unknown.
- CONFIRMED (CLI run, 15 s, no user input): no notifications. So the earlier packet is not a handshake sent on every subscribe; it may be an event or periodic status. UNVERIFIED which.
- UNVERIFIED: button, touch and wake-word traffic. Neither listen session was run with confirmed physical input.

## Frame format and commands

None known. `protocol/commands.yaml` is empty until the Phase 3 capture.
